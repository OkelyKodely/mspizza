We welcome groups to exclusively reserve Bresca and treat their guests to our exciting approach to modern bistronomy. We can accommodate standing receptions of up to 115 guests, or seated dinners of up to 70 in our main dining room. 

LARGE GROUP DINNER EVENTS- We can also accommodate smaller dinner groups of 9 to 25 with a specially curated menu in the dining room. Groups will be seated in our dining room at either one table (up to 18 guests) or multiple adjacent tables.  A variety of dining options are available from a family style communal feast to a seasonally inspired tasting menu. Please contact us for more information. We look forward to hosting you!						</p>
